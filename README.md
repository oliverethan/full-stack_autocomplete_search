An autocomplete search bar with client server and database implemented. Designed from scratch in **1 day** from this prompt:


#### Design a web client that allows a user to input a search terms related to drug records and return suggestions based on the input.

* Sequence Diagram depicting the service calls between browser and server and sequence flow between server components (see blank template below).
* Service Specification (API Doc) depicting the parameters that are sent to each service calls and the response from those calls (see blank template below).
* Data model depicting the entities and their fields that are stored in the data tier (see source data below).
* High level architecture diagram depicting the different technologies you would employ to accomplish the design. This is your chance to show us your experience with web technologies, so we recommend you pick technologies you are most familiar with.
